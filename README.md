# Financial-Distress-Modelling
Financial distress refers to the condition of a company's financial unhealthiness or decline in financial condition before bankruptcy or liquidation. Financial distress can occur in various companies and can be an indication or signal that the company is potentially bankrupt.

The following are the limitations of the problem given:
1. The data used is limited to the financial ratios of banking sector companies in the range 2013 - 2022.
2. The variables to be used in this study consist of the financial ratios CAR, ROA, ROE, NIM, LDR BOPO, NPL.
3. The financial ratio limitation parameter is the threshold parameter set by Bank Indonesia.
4. The method that will be used in this research is Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

Based on the formulation of the problems that have been prepared, the overall objective of this study is to obtain an accurate financial distress classification model for banking companies in Indonesia. Specifically, the objectives of this study are as follows:
1. Describe the characteristics of financial ratios that distinguish healthy banks and banks experiencing financial problems in Indonesia.
2. Identify variables that have a significant influence on the financial condition of banks.
3. Comparing financial distress classification models using financial ratios for banking companies in Indonesia using Extreme Gradient Boosting and Artificial Neural Network algorithms .
